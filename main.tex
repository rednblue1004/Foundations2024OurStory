Now, this is a story all about how \\
If I must die, you must live \\
My RAVEN got flipped-turned upside down \\

And I'd like to take a minute \\
Just sit right there \\
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Sacramento \\

In West  Arizona born and raised \\
On the playground was where I spent most of my days \\
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool \\
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school \\
When a couple of guys who were up to no good \\
Started making trouble in my neighborhood \\
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared \\
She said, ``You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Sacramento". Everything going great. \\


I begged and pleaded with her day after day \\
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way \\
She kissed me and then she gave me my ticket \\
I put my Walkman on and said, ``I might as well kick it" \\

First class, yo this is bad \\
Is this what the people of Sacramento living like? \\

Hmm, this might be alright \\

But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that \\
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? \\
I don't think so \\
I'll see when I get there \\
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Sacramento \\

Well, the plane landed and when I came out \\
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out \\
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here \\
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared \\

I screamed for a cab and when it came near \\
The license plate said, ``Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror \\
If anything I could say that this cab was rare \\
But I thought ``Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Sacramento" \\

I pulled up to the house about seven or eight \\
And I yelled to the cabbie, ``Yo holmes, smell ya later" \\
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there, here, everywhere
To sit on my throne as the prince of Sacramento
